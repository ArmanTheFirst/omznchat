# Security Policy

## ⚠️ Project Status

**IMPORTANT:** This project is currently in pre-alpha development and is **NOT production-ready**. It has not been audited for security and should not be used with sensitive data or in production environments.

## 🔒 Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

**DO NOT file public GitHub issues for security vulnerabilities.**

If you discover a security vulnerability in this project, please report it responsibly:

### Reporting Methods

1. **GitHub Private Vulnerability Reporting** (Preferred)
   - Use GitHub's [private vulnerability reporting feature](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing/privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability)
   - Navigate to the Security tab and click "Report a vulnerability"

2. **Private Issue**
   - Create a new issue with "[SECURITY]" in the title
   - Mark it as private if possible
   - Do not include specific exploit details in public issues

### What to Include

When reporting a vulnerability, please include:

- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Potential impact
- Affected versions/components
- Any suggested fixes (if applicable)

## 🛡️ Security Considerations

### For Users

- ⚠️ This software is provided "as is" without security guarantees
- 🚫 Do not use this application with sensitive or confidential data
- 🚫 Do not deploy this application in production environments
- ⚠️ Expect potential security vulnerabilities as the project is under active development

### For Developers

- Never commit sensitive credentials, API keys, or secrets to the repository
- Always use environment variables for configuration
- Keep dependencies up to date
- Follow OWASP security best practices
- Review the [Contributing Guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) for secure development practices

## 📋 Bug Bounty Program

**We do not currently offer a bug bounty program.** This is an open-source project in early development. However, we appreciate all responsible security disclosures and will acknowledge contributors who report valid security issues.

## 🔄 Response Timeline

While we aim to respond to security reports promptly:

- Initial response: Within 7 days
- Status update: Within 14 days
- Resolution timeline: Depends on severity and complexity

Please note that as this is a pre-alpha project maintained by volunteers, response times may vary.

## ⚖️ Disclosure Policy

We follow a coordinated disclosure approach:

1. Reporter submits vulnerability privately
2. We acknowledge receipt and investigate
3. We develop and test a fix
4. We release the fix
5. Public disclosure is made after the fix is available

We request that security researchers:

- Give us reasonable time to address the issue before public disclosure
- Avoid exploiting the vulnerability beyond what is necessary to demonstrate it
- Do not access, modify, or delete data belonging to others

## 📞 Contact
